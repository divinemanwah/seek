Notes:

	- I was going to make it a deployable Vagrant distribution but I ran out of time.
	- I also didn't have enough time to write unit tests, and I apologize for that.
	- A nice feature too would be a Rules manager. But in the meantime, the algorithm can be seen at database/seeds/RulesTableSeeder.php.

------------------

Prerequisites:

	PHP >= 5.6.4 (http://php.net)
	Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
	MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/)
	Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)

------------------

Please copy .env.example to .env and supply appropriate database settings (host, port, existing database name, and credentials). Set SESSION_DRIVER to "database" (without quotes).
This is a separate step because every installation has different .env files.

Then run the following in order:

	php artisan key:generate
		
		- This generates the application key for the .env file (**do this only once per install!)
	
	
	composer install
		
		- This will download and install all the PHP dependencies (**do this only once per install!)
	
	
	npm install
	
		- This will download and install all the JavaScript dependencies (**do this only once per install!)
	
	
	php artisan migrate
	
		- This creates all the required tables (**do this only once per install!)
	
	
	php artisan db:seed
		
		- This populates the created tables (**do this only once per install!)
	
	
	php artisan serve
	
		- This will launch the app
		

The will run in port 8000 by default, but you can change that by running "php artisan serve --port=xxxx" instead.

If something went wrong or if you have any clarifications to my solution, please contact me through my email or Skype id written above.
